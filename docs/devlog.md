# Development Log

---

## Prototype Started

Initial Godot 4.7.1 .NET project created.

Goal:

Evaluate whether a third-person 3D zombie survival game is feasible using Godot and AI-assisted development.

---

## Player Controller

Completed:

- Third-person movement
- Mouse camera
- Idle animation
- Walking animation
- Running animation

Outcome:

Movement feels responsive and forms a good baseline.

---

## Environment Prototype

Completed:

- Road
- Ground
- Trees
- House
- Abandoned car

Outcome:

Successfully imported third-party assets.

Performance remained around 60 FPS using the Compatibility renderer.

---

## Zombie Prototype

Completed:

- Detection
- Navigation
- Chase
- Attack

Outcome:

Zombie successfully detects, chases and attacks the player.

This validates navigation, animation transitions and basic AI behaviour.

---

## Player Stamina

Completed:

- Sprint stamina drain
- Delayed stamina regeneration
- Exhaustion lockout and recovery threshold
- Stamina HUD bar
- Run animation tied to actual sprint state

Outcome:

Walking remains unchanged, while sprinting is now a limited resource with clear visual feedback.

---

## Current Milestone

Working on:

Vertical Slice 1

Next objective:

Awaiting the next focused vertical-slice task.

## Notes

Important findings:

- Godot 4.7.1 performs well on the current laptop.
- Compatibility renderer is sufficient.
- Mixamo integrates smoothly.
- AI-assisted workflow is productive.
- Small focused implementation tasks produce the best results.
- Raw third-party asset packs should remain outside the project until curated.
