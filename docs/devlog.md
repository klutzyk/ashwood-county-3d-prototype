# Development Log

---

## Prototype Started

Initial Godot 4.7.1 .NET project created.

Goal:

Evaluate whether a third-person 3D zombie survival game is feasible using Godot and AI-assisted development.

---

## Player Controller

Completed:

- Third-person movement
- Mouse camera
- Idle animation
- Walking animation
- Running animation

Outcome:

Movement feels responsive and forms a good baseline.

---

## Environment Prototype

Completed:

- Road
- Ground
- Trees
- House
- Abandoned car

Outcome:

Successfully imported third-party assets.

Performance remained around 60 FPS using the Compatibility renderer.

---

## Zombie Prototype

Completed:

- Detection
- Navigation
- Chase
- Attack

Outcome:

Zombie successfully detects, chases and attacks the player.

This validates navigation, animation transitions and basic AI behaviour.

---

## Player Stamina

Completed:

- Sprint stamina drain
- Delayed stamina regeneration
- Exhaustion lockout and recovery threshold
- Stamina HUD bar
- Run animation tied to actual sprint state

Outcome:

Walking remains unchanged, while sprinting is now a limited resource with clear visual feedback.

---

## Interaction Framework

Completed:

- Reusable interactable component and callback signal
- Closest interactable selection within a configurable range
- E-key interaction input
- Contextual interaction prompt
- Abandoned car interaction callback

Outcome:

The player can select and trigger one nearby interactable at a time. The abandoned car prints a prototype message; searching, items and loot remain unimplemented.

---

## Searching Prototype

Completed:

- Hold-E search action
- Two-second progress bar
- Movement and sprint lock during searching
- Cancellation when E is released or the target becomes invalid
- Abandoned car search completion callback

Outcome:

The abandoned car can now be searched through a timed, cancellable interaction. Search results, items and loot remain unimplemented.

---

## Item Prototype

Completed:

- Reusable item definition resource
- Minimal quantity-based player inventory
- Bandage item resource
- One-time Bandage reward from searching the abandoned car

Outcome:

Completing the car search grants exactly one Bandage. Item display and item use remain unimplemented.

---

## Inventory Display

Completed:

- Fixed four-slot player inventory
- Four-slot HUD display
- Automatic slot refresh when items are added
- Bandage name and quantity shown after searching the car

Outcome:

The player can see the Bandage in the first inventory slot after searching the abandoned car. Item selection and use remain unimplemented.

---

## Bandage Use

Completed:

- Slot 1 item-use input
- Bandage health restoration
- Successful-use item consumption
- Full-health and death safeguards

Outcome:

Pressing 1 uses the Bandage to restore 40 health and removes it from the inventory. The Bandage is not consumed when healing cannot occur.

---

## Current Milestone

Working on:

Vertical Slice 1

Next objective:

Awaiting the next focused vertical-slice task.

## Notes

Important findings:

- Godot 4.7.1 performs well on the current laptop.
- Compatibility renderer is sufficient.
- Mixamo integrates smoothly.
- AI-assisted workflow is productive.
- Small focused implementation tasks produce the best results.
- Raw third-party asset packs should remain outside the project until curated.
